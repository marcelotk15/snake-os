This project will create a simple command line tool for generating
LanMan and NT MD4 password hashes which can be used to populate 
 smbpasswd, LDAP, etc entries for user's.  The source files are taken
from the sambapasswd and smbpasscheck programs included with Nigel 
William's NISGina softweare.  

You will need to obtain Eric Young's DES library from 
ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/DES in order to build the
smbencrypt binary.  Extract the library into a subdirectory
named libdes/.  After building libdes.a creating symlinks
in the smbencrypt directory by

	$ ln -s libdes/des.h
	$ ln -s libdes/libdes.a

Then run 'make' to create smbencrypt
